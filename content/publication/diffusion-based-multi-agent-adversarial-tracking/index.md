abstract: Target tracking plays a crucial role in real-world scenarios, particularly
  in drug-trafficking interdiction, where the knowledge of an adversarial target's
  location is often limited. Improving autonomous tracking systems will enable unmanned
  aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles to better assist in interdicting smugglers
  that use manned surface, semi-submersible, and aerial vessels. As unmanned drones
  proliferate, accurate autonomous target estimation is even more crucial for security
  and safety. This paper presents Constrained Agent-based Diffusion for Enhanced Multi-Agent
  Tracking (CADENCE), an approach aimed at generating comprehensive predictions of
  adversary locations by leveraging past sparse state information. To assess the effectiveness
  of this approach, we evaluate predictions on single-target and multi-target pursuit
  environments, employing Monte-Carlo sampling of the diffusion model to â€¦
