 abstract = {This paper describes an image based visual servoing (IBVS) system for a nonholonomic robot to achieve good trajectory following without real-time robot pose information and without a known visual map of the environment. We call it trajectory servoing. The critical component is a featurebased, indirect SLAM method to provide a pool of available features with estimated depth, so that they may be propagated forward in time to generate image feature trajectories for visual servoing. Short and long distance experiments show the benefits of trajectory servoing for navigating unknown areas without absolute positioning. Trajectory servoing is shown to be more accurate than pose-based feedback when both rely on the same underlying SLAM system.},
