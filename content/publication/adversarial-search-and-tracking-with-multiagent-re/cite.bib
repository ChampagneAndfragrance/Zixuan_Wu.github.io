 abstract = {We study a search and tracking (S&T) problem where a team of dynamic search agents must collaborate to track an adversarial, evasive agent. The heterogeneous search team may only have access to a limited number of past adversary trajectories within a large search space. This problem is challenging for both model-based searching and reinforcement learning (RL) methods since the adversary exhibits reactionary and deceptive evasive behaviors in a large space leading to sparse detections for the search agents. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework that leverages the estimated adversary location from our learnable filtering model. We show that our MARL architecture can outperform all baselines and achieves a 46% increase in detection rate.},
