abstract: We study a search and tracking (S&T) problem where a team of dynamic search
  agents must collaborate to track an adversarial, evasive agent. The heterogeneous
  search team may only have access to a limited number of past adversary trajectories
  within a large search space. This problem is challenging for both model-based searching
  and reinforcement learning (RL) methods since the adversary exhibits reactionary
  and deceptive evasive behaviors in a large space leading to sparse detections for
  the search agents. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Agent RL
  (MARL) framework that leverages the estimated adversary location from our learnable
  filtering model. We show that our MARL architecture can outperform all baselines
  and achieves a 46% increase in detection rate.
