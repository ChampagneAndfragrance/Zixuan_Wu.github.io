abstract: Robot navigation tasks are usually decomposed into sequential sub-tasks,
  thus requiring a hierarchical design of sub-systems governed by multiple decision
  and control loops. In practice, people are the experts in making high-level decisions
  based on environmental knowledge. However, obtaining the local, real-time environment
  information is difficult by ourselves, especially in unreachable or dangerous environments.
  On the contrary, robots are good at achieving lower-level tasks such as building
  a cost map and detecting nearby obstacles. Therefore, teleoperation is used to coordinate
  strategic human brains and faithful robot sensors and actuators, providing an information-sharing
  protocol that helps to build a human-in-loop system. In this paper, we design a
  set of interactive Robot Operating System (ROS) based teleoperation windows for
  the operators to supervise the robot’s navigation through uncertain …
