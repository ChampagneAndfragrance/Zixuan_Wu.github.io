abstract: Optimizing large-scale logistics is computationally challenging due to its
  scale and requirement to be robust to stochastic and time-varying weather disturbances.
  However, prior research in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) does not address
  scenarios that capture complexity of logistics operations influenced by dynamic
  weather patterns. To address this gap, we suggest a new MARL environment,  that
  has two types of agents equipped with limited resources and integrates real wave
  data to model the influences of weather on the replenishment at sea (RAS) operation.
  To this end, we propose SchedHGNN, a novel MARL algorithm that incorporates a heterogeneous
  graph neural network and an intrinsic reward scheme to enhance agent coordination
  and mitigate challenges induced by environment non-stationarity. Our results show
  that the combination of effective RAS scheduling and improved â€¦
