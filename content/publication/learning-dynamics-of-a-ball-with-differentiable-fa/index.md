abstract: Robots in dynamic environments need fast, accurate models of how objects
  move in their environments to support agile planning. In sports such as ping pong,
  analytical models often struggle to accurately predict ball trajectories with spins
  due to complex aerodynamics, elastic behaviors, and the challenges of modeling sliding
  and rolling friction. On the other hand, despite the promise of data-driven methods,
  machine learning struggles to make accurate, consistent predictions without precise
  input. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework that can jointly
  train a dynamics model and a factor graph estimator. Our approach leverages a Gram-Schmidt
  (GS) process to extract roto-translational invariant representations to improve
  the model performance, which can further reduce the validation error compared to
  data augmentation method. Additionally, we propose a network architecture that enhances
  nonlinearity by using self-multiplicative bypasses in the layer connections. By
  leveraging these novel methods, our proposed approach predicts the ball's position
  with an RMSE of 37.2 mm of the paddle radius at the apex after the first bounce,
  and 71.5 mm after the second bounce.
