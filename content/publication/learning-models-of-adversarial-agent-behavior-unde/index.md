abstract: The need for opponent modeling and tracking arises in several real-world
  scenarios, such as professional sports, video game design, and drug-trafficking
  interdiction. In this work, we present Graph based Adversarial Modeling with Mutual
  Information (GrAMMI) for modeling the behavior of an adversarial opponent agent.
  GrAMMI is a novel graph neural network (GNN) based approach that uses mutual information
  maximization as an auxiliary objective to predict the current and future states
  of an adversarial opponent with partial observability. To evaluate GrAMMI, we design
  two large-scale, pursuit-evasion domains inspired by real-world scenarios, where
  a team of heterogeneous agents is tasked with tracking and interdicting a single
  adversarial agent, and the adversarial agent must evade detection while achieving
  its own objectives. With the mutual information formulation, GrAMMI outperforms
  all baselines in â€¦
