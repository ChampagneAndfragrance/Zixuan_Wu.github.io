abstract: This article describes a stereo image-based visual servoing (VS) system
  for trajectory tracking by a nonholonomic robot without externally derived pose
  information nor a known visual map of the environment. It is called trajectory servoing
  (TS). The critical component is a feature-based, indirect simultaneous localization
  and mapping (SLAM) method to provide a pool of available features with estimated
  depth, so that they may be propagated forward in time to generate image feature
  trajectories for VS. Short and long distance experiments show the benefits of TS
  for navigating unknown areas without absolute positioning. Empirically, TS has better
  trajectory tracking performance than pose-based feedback when both rely on the same
  underlying SLAM system.
