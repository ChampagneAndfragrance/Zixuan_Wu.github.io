 abstract = {We study a search and tracking (S&T) problem where a team of dynamic search agents must collaborate to track an adversarial, evasive agent. The heterogeneous search team may only have access to a limited number of past adversary trajectories within a large search space. This problem is challenging for both model-based searching and reinforcement learning (RL) methods since the adversary exhibits reactionary and deceptive evasive behaviors in a large space leading to sparse detections for the search agents. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework that leverages the estimated adversary location from our learnable filtering model. We show that our MARL architecture can outperform all baselines and achieves a 46% increase in detection rate.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement Learning- (RL-)based motion planning has recently shown the potential to outperform traditional approaches from autonomous navigation to robot manipulation. In this work, we focus on a motion planning task for an evasive target in a partially observable multi-agent adversarial pursuit-evasion games (PEG). These pursuit-evasion problems are relevant to various applications, such as search and rescue operations and surveillance robots, where robots must effectively plan their actions to gather intelligence or accomplish mission tasks while avoiding detection or capture themselves. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level diffusion model to plan global paths responsive to environment data while a low-level RL algorithm reasons about evasive versus global path-following behavior. Our approach outperforms baselines by 51.2% by leveraging the diffusion model to guide the RL algorithm for more efficient exploration and improves the explanability and predictability.},

@misc{Hijacking_Robot_Teams_Through_Adversarial_Communic,
 abstract = {Communication is often necessary for robot teams to collaborate and complete a decentralized task. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems allow agents to learn how to collaborate and communicate to complete a task. These domains are ubiquitous and include safety-critical domains such as wildfire fighting, traffic control, or search and rescue missions. However, critical vulnerabilities may arise in communication systems as jamming the signals can interrupt the robot team. This work presents a framework for applying black-box adversarial attacks to learned MARL policies by manipulating only the communication signals between agents. Our system only requires observations of MARL policies after training is complete, as this is more realistic than attacking the training process. To this end, we imitate a learned policy of the targeted agents without direct interaction with the environment or ground truth rewards. Instead, we infer the rewards by only observing the behavior of the targeted agents. Our framework reduces reward by 201% compared to an equivalent baseline method and also shows favorable results when deployed in real swarm robots. Our novel attack methodology within MARL systems contributes to the field by enhancing our understanding on the reliability of multi-agent systems.},

The critical component is a feature-based, indirect simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method to provide a pool of available features with estimated depth, so that they may be propagated forward in time to generate image feature trajectories for VS. Short and long distance experiments show the benefits of TS for navigating unknown areas without absolute positioning.

@misc{Learning_Diverse_Robot_Striking_Motions_with_Diffu,
 abstract = {Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.},

 abstract = {Robots in dynamic environments need fast, accurate models of how objects move in their environments to support agile planning. In sports such as ping pong, analytical models often struggle to accurately predict ball trajectories with spins due to complex aerodynamics, elastic behaviors, and the challenges of modeling sliding and rolling friction. On the other hand, despite the promise of data-driven methods, machine learning struggles to make accurate, consistent predictions without precise input. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework that can jointly train a dynamics model and a factor graph estimator. Our approach leverages a Gram-Schmidt (GS) process to extract roto-translational invariant representations to improve the model performance, which can further reduce the validation error compared to data augmentation method. Additionally, we propose a network architecture that enhances nonlinearity by using self-multiplicative bypasses in the layer connections. By leveraging these novel methods, our proposed approach predicts the ball's position with an RMSE of 37.2 mm of the paddle radius at the apex after the first bounce, and 71.5 mm after the second bounce.},

Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned policy can serve as a local planner in conjunction with position control. We apply this framework in the wheelchair tennis navigation problem to guide the wheelchair into the ball-hitting region. Our pipeline achieves a navigation success rate of 97.67% in reaching real-world recorded tennis ball trajectories with a physical robot wheelchair, and achieve a success rate of 68.49% in a real-world, real-time experiment on a full-sized tennis court.},

However, obtaining the local, real-time environment information is difficult by ourselves, especially in unreachable or dangerous environments. On the contrary, robots are good at achieving lower-level tasks such as building a cost map and detecting nearby obstacles. Therefore, teleoperation is used to coordinate strategic human brains and faithful robot sensors and actuators, providing an information-sharing protocol that helps to build a human-in-loop system.

@misc{Trajectory_Servoing_Image_Based_Trajectory_Trackin,
 abstract = {Navigation systems with real-time needs often employ hierarchical schemes that decompose navigation across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Doing so permits the navigation solution to respond in real-time to novel information gained from sensors, while being guided by the more slowly evolving global path. At the lowest level of the hierarchy lies trajectory tracking to realize the planned paths or synthesized trajectories. In the absence of an absolute reference (such as GPS) and of an accurate map of the environment, there are no external mechanisms to support trajectory tracking. Onboard mechanisms include odometry through proprioceptive sensors (wheel encoders, IMUs, etc.) or visual sensors. Pose estimation from proprioceptive sensors is not observable, thus visual sensors provide the best mechanism to anchor the robot’s pose estimate to external, static position references.Indeed visual odometry (VO) or visual SLAM (V-SLAM) solutions are essential in these circumstances. However, they too experience drift, mostly due to the integrated effects of measurement noise and system latency. Specificly, the feedback rate from multiple sensor (IMU, Camera, etc.) and control loops are impossible to be perfectly matched since each latency varies, therefore, raw IMU data uncorrected by VO may be directily sent to controller and cause tracking deviation [1]. Additionally, the accumulation of noise (eg IMU bias, camera noise, calibration error, etc.) will cause the VO drift [2] and further undermine the trajectory tracking. From the limitation of cost, cameras that are compatible with small robots are easily be affected by Johnson-Nyquist thermal …},
